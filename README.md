## MetroBin
A modern Pastebin, features Pasting, editing Pastes and deleting them. Written in PHP and styled with MetroUI.

## Setup
- Put all files to root directory
- Create a Database in MySQL and import "metrobin.sql"
- Goto "core/config.php" and make changes
- Done

## Security?
No matter what people enter in the paste field, even if it's a PHP script, it won't be executed since it will be shown in a Textarea. If you found any bugs/issues, please report them via an Issue on GitHub/H33Tx/MetroBin. Thx!
